# Eat-A-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the queue area also has a devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The premise of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create and launch a fully functional webapp.
